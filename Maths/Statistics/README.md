## Types of Statistics

1. Descriptive  Statistics
   1. Describe the data
   2. Data Analysis
   3. Provide simple summaries about the sample and the measure
   4. Two important measures of Descriptive Statistics:
      1. Measure of Central Tendencies ( Mean, Median, Mode)
      2. Measure of Variability ( Range, Standard Deviation, Variance)
2. Inferential Statistics
   1. Get inferences about the data
   2. Data Science
   3. Takes sample data and makes inferences and predictions about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. 



## Sampling Techniques

* Simple Random Sampling
  * selecting randomly
* Systematic Sampling
  * sample is picked from the population at regular intervals
  * carried out when the population is homogeneous and the data is uniformly distributed 
* Stratified Random Sampling
  * the population is subdivided into smaller groups called Srata. Samples are obtained randomly from all these strata.
* Cluster Sampling
  * carried out on population that has inherent groups. 
  * population is subdivided into clusters and then randomly clusters are taken as sample.



## Central  Tendency

A measure of central tendency is a value that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset. It is a value that summarizes the data. 

Central tendencies are very useful in handling the missing values in a dataset

* Mean 
  * Missing values in a dataset can be replaces with **mean** value, if the data is uniformly ( same range ) distributed 
* Median
  * Missing values in a dataset can be replaces with **median** value, if the data is skewed
* Mode
  * Missing values in a dataset can be replaces with **mode** value, if the data is skewed.
  * Missing categorical values can also be replaced with mode value.



## Measure of  Variability

* Range
  * Difference b/w the largest and smallest value
* Variance
  * A measure of how far each member in the set is from the mean and therefore from every other member in the dataset
* Standard Deviation
  * square root of variance.
  * It looks at how spread out a group of numbers is from the mean



## Correlation and Causation

1. **Correlation** is a measure hat determines the extent to which two variables are related to each other. But it doesn't mean that one event is the cause of the other event.

   1. **Positive Correlation** : directly proportional
   2. **Negative Correlation** : inversely proportional

   

2. **Causation** means that one event causes another event to occur. There is a cause and effect relationship b/w two variables in a dataset.
